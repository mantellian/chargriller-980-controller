| GPIO17 | SCL | INA219 SCL | 🔵 Blue | I2C Clock |

**I2C Address**: 0x40 (default for INA219)

**Pull-up Resistors**: Not required - ESP32 has internal pull-ups enabled in software

---

**Encoder Module Notes:**
- Most KY-040 modules have built-in pull-up resistors
- ESP32 enables internal pull-ups in software for redundancy
- If encoder is "jumpy" or misses steps, add 0.1µF capacitors between each signal pin and GND

---

## Door/Lid Switch

| ESP32 Pin | Signal | Switch Terminal | Wire Color | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| GPIO13 | Input | Terminal 1 | 🟡 Yellow | Signal input |
| GND | Ground | Terminal 2 | ⚫ Black | Ground |

**Switch Type**: Normally Open (NO)

                                                       ↓
                                                 MOSFET Source → GND
                                                 
Fan Positive (Red) → 12V+ (direct connection)

**MOSFET Module Notes:**
- If using pre-made MOSFET module, gate resistor and flyback diode may be included

|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| GPIO4 | Control | + (Positive) | 🟣 Purple | Active-high control |
| GND | Ground | - (Negative) | ⚫ Black | Ground |

**Buzzer Type**: Must be **ACTIVE** buzzer (has internal oscillator)
- 2-wire active buzzer (not 3-wire passive)
- 5V rated, typically draws 20-30mA
- If too quiet, consider adding transistor driver

**Testing**: Connect to 5V directly - should produce continuous tone

---

## Grounding Architecture (CRITICAL)

Use **star grounding** to minimize noise and ground loops:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   12V PSU -     │
                    │  (STAR POINT)   │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
           ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
           │                 │                 │
           │                 │                 │
      ESP32 GND         Buck GND          INA219 GND
           │                 │                 │
           │                 │            MOSFET Source
           │                 │                 │
      MAX31855 GND      TM1637 #1          Fan Ground
           │                 │
      Encoder GND       TM1637 #2
           │                 │
      Door Switch       Buzzer GND
```

**Grounding Rules:**
1. All grounds eventually connect at **ONE** central point (star)
2. No ground loops (no circular paths)
3. Keep high-current ground (fan) as short as possible
4. Run separate ground wires - don't daisy-chain

## Power Supply Requirements

### Input Power
| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Voltage | 12V DC (11.5-12.5V acceptable) |
| Current | 5A recommended (3A minimum) |
| Connector | 2.1mm barrel jack or screw terminals |
| Type | Regulated switching power supply |

### Current Budget
| Component | Voltage | Current Draw | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| ESP32 | 5V | 500mA | Peak during WiFi transmission |
| TM1637 #1 | 5V | 100mA | At full brightness |
| TM1637 #2 | 5V | 100mA | At full brightness |
| Buzzer | 5V | 30mA | When active |
| MAX31855 | 3.3V | 2mA | From ESP32 regulator |
| INA219 | 3.3V | 1mA | From ESP32 regulator |
| **5V Rail Total** | | **~730mA** | Use 2A buck converter for headroom |

## Wiring Best Practices

### Wire Gauge Selection
| Circuit | Recommended Gauge | Max Length |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| 12V main power | 18 AWG | 6 feet |
| 5V power distribution | 22 AWG | 3 feet |
| 3.3V signals | 22-24 AWG | 2 feet |
| Digital signals | 22-24 AWG | 1 foot |

### Wire Management
1. **Use ferrules on stranded wire** - Prevents fraying in screw terminals
2. **Twist thermocouple wires together** - Reduces EMI pickup
3. **Separate power and signal wires** - Avoid parallel runs > 6 inches
4. **Keep SPI wires short** - MAX31855 is sensitive to capacitance
5. **Label everything** - Use label maker or masking tape
6. **Use heat shrink** - Cover all solder joints and connections
7. **Strain relief** - Secure wires near connectors

### Color Code Recommendations
| Purpose | Color | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 12V positive | 🔴 Red | High voltage power |
| 5V positive | 🔴 Red | Lower voltage power |
| 3.3V positive | 🟠 Orange | Logic power |
| Ground (any) | ⚫ Black | All returns |
| I2C SDA | ⚪ White | Data signal |
| I2C SCL | 🔵 Blue | Clock signal |
| SPI Clock | 🟡 Yellow | Clock signal |
| SPI Data | 🟢 Green | Data signal |
| PWM/Control | 🔵 Blue or 🟣 Purple | Control signals |

**Note**: These are suggestions - use what you have, but **document your actual colors**!

## Pre-Power Checklist

Before applying power for the first time:

### Visual Inspection
- [ ] All solder joints shiny and solid (no cold joints)
- [ ] No solder bridges between pads
- [ ] No exposed wire strands near terminals
- [ ] All ICs oriented correctly (check pin 1 markers)
- [ ] Antenna connected to ESP32 U.FL connector
- [ ] Heat sinks installed on buck converter and MOSFET (if needed)

### Continuity Testing (Power OFF)
- [ ] Verify ground continuity between all GND points
- [ ] Verify NO continuity between 12V and GND
- [ ] Verify NO continuity between 5V and GND
- [ ] Verify NO continuity between 3.3V and GND
- [ ] Check for shorts on all power rails

### Voltage Testing (12V connected, ESP32 disconnected)
- [ ] Measure 12V rail: 11.5-12.5V
- [ ] Adjust buck converter to exactly 5.0V (±0.05V)
- [ ] Verify no voltage on signal pins (except pull-ups)

### First Power-On (12V + ESP32)
- [ ] Power on and monitor for smoke/heat
- [ ] Check ESP32 LED indicators (should blink)
- [ ] Verify 5V rail remains stable
- [ ] Check 3.3V output from ESP32
- [ ] Feel components for excessive heat
